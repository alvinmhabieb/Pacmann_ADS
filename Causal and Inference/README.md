# Introduction
The project aims to delve into the intricacies of crime rate data for North Carolina, spanning from 1981 to 1987, with a focus on understanding and analyzing patterns across various counties. By conducting a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project seeks to uncover underlying trends and relationships within the dataset, providing a clearer picture of how crime rates vary over time and across different regions. A key objective is to identify which socio-economic and demographic factors are most closely linked to fluctuations in crime rates, using both univariate and bivariate analyses to explore these associations.
