# Data-Wrangling-and-SQL-Pacmann---Olist-Brazilian-E-Commerce
My portfolio about data wrangling using SQL and Python in Pacmann.

## Introduction
This information was obtained from Brazilian E-Commerce, Olist between 2016 and 2018, and it was made available on Kaggle in September 2018. Customers, sellers, and transactions are included in the current data. The image below shows the database scheme in depth. The goal of this analysis is to comprehend the procedure for prepping and cleaning data prior to analysis. For e-commerce Olist, the analysis must be pertinent and capable of offering business suggestions. Before beginning the research, the dataset must first be checked. Missing numbers, inconsistent variables, different data types, and outliers are a few of them. For this reason, cleansing and preparing the data is necessary prior to analysis.
